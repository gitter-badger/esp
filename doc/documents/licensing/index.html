            <h2>Open Source License</h2>
            <p>ESP my be used with the <a href="gpl.html">GPL Open Source license</a>. This is ideal for evaluating
            ESP, for internal use, stand-alone use, or for integrating exclusively with other GPL software.
            If you intend to distribute your software and link ESP with your application, the GPL requires you 
            to provide public and full access to all source code and documentation on a nondiscriminatory basis.
            If you do not wish to provide source code to your application, you must purchase a commercial license.</p>
            
            <h3>Evaluating ESP</h3>
            <p>If you are evaluating ESP internally, and not distributing any products containing ESP, then you may
            be able to use the GPL license for this evaluation. Once complete, you may purchase a commercial license so 
            that you can distribute your product. You may evaluate, develop, modify, and embed ESP in your
            application or product provided it is not distributed. You may copy and modify the source code provided 
            all copies fall under the GPL license.</p>

            <h3>Stand Alone Use</h3>
            <p>If you are using ESP in a stand-alone manner as free-standing binaries, and are not integrating the
            ESP source code or libraries with your software to create a derivative work, then the GPL license may
            be sufficient. Stand-alone use does not permit linking ESP using either static or dynamic linking.</p>

            <h3>Use with Other GPL Software</h3>
            <p>If you are integrating ESP source or libraries into your application and your software is also 
            fully licensed under the GPL license, you may use ESP with the GPL  license and embed ESP
            in your applications or devices. You do not need any other agreement or license &mdash; the GPL is all you
            require.</p>

            <h3>Embedding with Non-GPL Software</h3>
            <p>If ESP is embedded into your application, or your application is linked using static or dynamic
            linking with libraries containing any ESP source code and you do not wish to publish your source code
            under the GPL, then you will need the ESP Commercial license.</p>

            questions about licensing ESP.</p>
