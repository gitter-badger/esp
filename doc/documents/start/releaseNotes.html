            <h2 >Helpful Hints</h2>
            <h3>Debug Trace and Logging</h3>
            <p>ESP has a debug logging and trace facility that can help when debugging configuration issues or
            developing your application code that uses ESP. You can vary the level of logging via the <b>--log
            logfile</b> command line switch for the <b>esp</b> commands. The log command line switch has the
            format:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
esp --log logFile:logLevel
</pre>
            <p>Use the <em>-v</em> switch to trace to the standard output at level 2.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
esp -v
</pre>
            <p>The log level can be from 0 to 5, with 5 being the most verbose level.</p>
