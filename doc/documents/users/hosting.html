            <h1>Hosting ESP in Appweb</h1>
            <p>ESP applications can run stand-alone via the <em>esp</em> utility command. Alternatively, they
            can be hosted in Appweb web server as part of a broader set of web services and content.</p>

            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>ESP applications are configured via their <em>package.json</em> file, but when hosted in Appweb, 
            some of this configuration is managed by the Appweb <em>appweb.conf</em> configuration file. 
            For background, please first read <a href="config.html">Configuring ESP</a> and the relevant sections of the
            <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/configuration.html">Appweb Configuration Guide</a>
            before reading this document.</p>

            <a id="module"></a>
            <h2 >ESP Module</h2>
            <p>Before ESP can be used in Appweb, the ESP web framework including the ESP handler must be loaded. 
            For Appweb, ESP is packaged as a loadable Appweb module called "<em>libmod_esp</em>". This is loaded 
            into Appweb via the <em>LoadModule</em> directive in the appweb.conf file.</p>

<pre class="ui code segment">LoadModule espHandler libmod_esp</pre>
            <p>This loads the <em>libmod_esp</em> module and invokes the ESP module initialization routine that registers
            ESP with Appweb.</p>
            <a id="handler"></a>
            <h2>ESP Handler</h2>
            <p>For ESP to receive incoming client requests, the Appweb router must be told what requests to send to ESP.
            The <em>AddHandler</em> directive below achieves this. It tells Appweb that the <em>espHandler</em> will service
            all URIs that end with "<em>.esp</em>".</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">AddHandler espHandler esp</pre>
            <p>This is all that is needed to service any ESP web page that ends with "<em>.esp</em>". If you want to
            ESP pages with another extension, you can specify extra extensions:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">AddHandler espHandler esp myesp</pre>
            <a id="errors"></a>
            <h3>Error Handling</h3>
            <p>If an ESP page has a syntax error or a run-time error, messages will be sent to the Appweb log file.
            This defaults to the file <em>error.log</em>. If appweb is run manually, you can see these message on 
            the console.</p> 
            <p>Often during development, it is useful to send errors back to the browser. To do this, add the following
            directive to appweb.conf.</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">ShowErrors on</pre>
            <p>This will display errors to the browser in addition to sending the errors to the Appweb log.</p>
            <a id="reload"></a>
            <h3>Reloading</h3>
            <p>ESP supports an "edit-and-continue" development style where you can make modifications to ESP controllers
            and pages and when you click reload in your browser, the controller or page will be transparently 
            recompiled and reloaded. This can be a great boost for development productivity.</p>
            <p>If your ESP application is running in debug mode, then ESP
            will automatically rebuild modified ESP pages and controllers. If your ESP application is running release mode,
            the default is to not reload. This default behavior can be modified via the package.json esp.mode setting.
            or the <em>EspUpdate</em> appweb.conf directive. </p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">EspUpdate on</pre>
            <a id="keep"></a>
            <h3>Keep Source</h3>
            <p>Sometimes, it is helpful to preserve intermediate "C" source files so that you can debug
            your application at the source code level. When an ESP page is parsed, it is blended with a layout page and
            then an intermediate C source file is generated. This is normally removed after compilation. Setting the
            <em>EspKeepSource</em> directive to "<em>on</em>" will cause ESP to preserve this intermediate source file
            in the <em>cache</em> directory.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">EspKeepSource on</pre>
            <a id="controllers"></a>
            <h2>ESP Controllers</h2>
            <p>ESP Controllers may be used as part of an ESP application or they may be used stand-alone outside
            an ESP app. A stand-alone controller must define a route that specifies the desired URI, the source file
            containing the controller and the format of the URI to action mapping. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
&lt;Route ^/greetings/{action}$&gt;
    SetHandler espHandler
    Source     greetings.c
    Target     run greetings-$1
&lt;/Route&gt;
</pre>
            <p>This defines a controller in <em>greeting.c</em> to respond to URIs that begin with <em>/greetings</em>.
            <p>Controllers are dynamically loaded and reloaded as required. Controllers contain one or more actions and have
            a module initialization routine that defines the actions for ESP to support. For example:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
#include "esp.h"
static void hello() {
    render("Hello World\n");
}
ESP_EXPORT int esp_module_greetings(HttpRoute *route) {
    espDefineAction(route, "greetings-hello", hello);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
            <p>This defines a single action which renders the string "Hello World\n" in response to the client request 
            for the URI <em>/greeting/hello</em>. When the URI is requested, the controller is compiled, linked into
            a dynamic library, saved in the cache directory and loaded into Appweb. If the source is modified, the 
            old controller is unloaded (after ensuring there are no active requests) and the new source is compiled and
            loaded.</p>
            <p>If you wish to pre-compile the controller, use the <em>esp</em> manager program. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">esp compile greetings.c</pre>
            <a id="app"></a>
            <h2 >ESP Applications</h2>
            <p>ESP applications typically require a little more configuration, but the ESP configuration
            defaults make this fairly painless.</p>
            <p>If your ESP application uses RESTful routes and follows the ESP defaults, the one-liner 
            EspApp directive is typically all you need. This directive takes the following arguments:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">&lt;EspApp name="NAME" prefix="URI" dir="Directory" routes="RouteSet"&gt;
   ...
&lt;EspApp&gt;</pre>
            <p>This defines an ESP application at the given directory that will receive 
            requests that begin with specified URI prefix. This will define a new Route block, inheriting the existing
            ESP and route configuration. For example, this directive defines a "blog" application stored in the "./blog" directory.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">&lt;EspApp prefix="/myblog" dir="./blog" routes="esp-html-mvc"&gt;
    ...
&lt;EspApp&gt;</pre>
            <p>With this configuration, Appweb will send client requests begin with the URI <em>/myblog</em> 
            to this ESP application at "./blog".</p>
            <p>Inside the EspApp directory, you can define other routes, configure caching, define resource limits
             or use most Appweb directives.</p>
            <h3>Separate Config</h3>
            <p>To modularize each ESP application, it is best practice to create a separate config file for each 
            application. This per-application config file should be saved to the <em>/etc/appweb/apps</em> or 
            on Windows, the <em>Embedthis Appweb/apps</em> directory. When Appweb is started or restarted, it will
            parse all the config files under the <em>apps</em>. Installing or removing a config file for each 
            application under the <em>apps</em> directory is a simple way to add/remove an application.</p>
            <a id="routing"></a>
            <h2 >ESP Routing</h2>
            <p>So far, we've covered the basics, but ESP provides very powerful routing and directives 
                that can be utilized to custom configure ESP applications. 
            An application will typically deal with various resources that need to be managed. For example, a WIFI
            router UI will need to manage the WIFI network name and password.  A network switch application may 
            need to manage a group of ethernet ports. Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL">RESTful Routes</a>,
            these resources are mapped onto HTTP methods and URIs in a simple and clear manner.</p>
            <p>ESP provides two directives to create URI routes for resources: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>EspPermResource &mdash; Create routes for a permanent resource (no create or delete)</li>
                    <li>EspResource &mdash; Create routes for a singleton resource</li>
                    <li>EspResourceGroup &mdash; Create routes for a group of resources</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>EspPermResource</h3>
            <p>The EspPermResource directive is used to create a RESTful set of routes to manage a permanent resource.
            A permanent resource is a resource that cannot be created or destroyed. It may be modifified and has 
            one or more related properties that are managed as a unit. 
            These routes define URI routes for get, update and custom actions.
            See the <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/esp.html#espPermResource">EspPermResource</a> 
            reference for details of the actual routes created.</p>

            <h3>EspResource</h3>
            <p>The EspResource directive is used to create a RESTful set of routes to manage a singleton resource.
            A singleton resource is one or more related properties that are managed as a unit, like the WIFI network
            name and password. These routes define URI routes for create, edit, get, init, remove, show and  
            update functions. See the <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/esp.html#espResource">
            EspResource</a> reference for details of the actual routes created.</p>

            <h3>EspResourceGroup</h3>
            <p>The EspResourceGroup directive is used to create a RESTful set of routes to manage a singleton resource.
            A group of resources is one or more instances of a resource that can be managed individually, like the 
            "port" on a network switch.
            See the <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/esp.html#espResourceGroup">EspResourceGroup</a>
            reference for details of the actual routes created.</p>

            <h3>EspRoute</h3>
            <p>For more control over individual routes, you can use the 
            <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/esp.html#espRoute">EspRoute</a> directive that will 
            create a route for a URI and map the URI to an ESP controller and action. For example: </p>

            <pre class="ui code segment">EspRoute name="/admin" methods="POST" prefix="^/wifi/admin/login"
 &nbsp; &rarr; target="admin-login" source="admin.c"</pre>

            <p>This will map <em>/wifi/admin/login</em> URI to the <em>admin</em> controller for the 
            <em>login</em> action.</p>

            <h3>Custom Routes</h3>
            <p>Sometimes you need a specific, custom mapping of a URI to an ESP controller and action. You can do this
            with the lowest-level Appweb directives:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/route.html#route">Route</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/route.html#name">Name</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/route.html#source">Source</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/route.html#target">Target</a></li>
                </ul>
            <a id="compilation"></a>
            <h2 >Compilation</h2>
            <p>At development time, ESP need to compile ESP controllers and pages into native binary.
            ESP supplies a pre-configured set of compilation commands for the major operating systems. These
            are stored in the <em>esp.conf</em> file which is located at <em>/usr/local/lib/appweb/bin</em> on Unix or on
            Windows at <em>C:/Program Files/Embedthis Appweb/bin</em>. The esp.conf file contains compile and link command
            templates using the <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/esp.html#espCompile">EspCompile</a> and optionally 
            <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/esp.html#espLink">EspLink</a>. For example:
<pre class="ui code segment">
EspCompile cc -shared ${DEBUG} -Wall -Wno-unused-result \
    -DPIC -fPIC -I. -I${INC} -L${LIB} -Wl,--enable-new-dtags \
    -Wl,-rpath,$ORIGIN ${LIBS} -o ${OUT}${SHOBJ} ${SRC}
</pre>
                <p>The various tokens in braces "${token}", are expanded at runtime depending on the configuration of
                Appweb. The esp.conf configuration file has conditional sections for Cygwin, Windows, Mac OS X, VxWorks and
                a default section for Linux/Unix. You can customize this file to suit your system. </p>
                <p>Some systems require a separate link phase. The <a
                    href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/esp.html#espLink">EspLink</a> command can be used to do a separate
                link. Other systems require that various environment variables be defined for the compiler and linker to
                successfully run. Use the <a href="https://embedthis.com/appweb/doc/users/dir/esp.html#espEnv">EspEnv</a> command for this.
            <h3>Cross Compilation</h3>
            <p>When cross-compiling, invoke the <em>esp</em> command with the "<em>--config</em>" switch to specify a
            separate config file for compiling on the target. Copy the standard <em>esp.conf</em> and modify the compile
            and link targets as required.</p>
            
            <a id="directives"></a>
            <h2 >Directives List</h2>
            <p>The following is a list of the various ESP directives and their purpose.</p>
