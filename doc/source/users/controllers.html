        <h1>Controllers and Actions</h1>
        <p>ESP <em>controllers</em> are the conductors of the application and they orchestrate the application's 
        logic and responses to client requests. Via <em>action</em> functions, they receive client requests and 
        generate appropriate responses, mutating the applications data model as required.</p>
        <p>An ESP controller is a "C" source file that contains action functions to receive to incoming client 
        requests and manage the applications response. The controller may be part of an ESP MVC application or it
        may be a stand-alone controller.</p>
        <a id="example"></a>
        <h2 >Example of a Controller</h2>
        <p>So what does a controller look like? Here is a partial example called <em>controllers/greeting.c</em>
        that has one action to say "Hello World".</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">
#include "esp.h"

static void hello() { 
    render("Hello World\n");
}

ESP_EXPORT int esp_controller_test_greeting(HttpRoute *route) 
{
    espDefineAction(route, "greeting-hello", hello);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
        <p>If the client browser issues a request for:</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">http://localhost/greeting/hello</pre>
        <p>ESP will compile the greeting.c controller and then load the controller and
        run the <em>hello</em> function which will respond to the client with "Hello World\n".</p>
 
        <a id="flow"></a>
        <h2 >Controller Processing</h2>
        <p>ESP process requests in stages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decode the URI and web request</li>
            <li>Route an incoming request to the ESP request handler</li>
            <li>If the request is for a controller, load the controller and run the requested action</li>
            <li>Run the specified controller action determined by the request route pattern</li>
            <li>If the request is for a web page or if the controller did not render a response 
                look for a matching web page and run that to render a response</li>
        </ol>
  
        <a id="routing"></a>
        <h2 >Routing Requests</h2>
        <p>At the heart of understanding how controllers are loaded and actions are run, is understanding request
        routing. When ESP HTTP server receives a client request, it examines each of the configured request routes. These
        may be configred via the <em>esp.json</em> or if hosted in Appweb, in the <em>appweb.conf</em> configuration file.
        The ESP HTTP server searches the route table, until it finds a matching route for the request URI. The 
        selected route will then break the URI into tokens and save the token values as request parameters.</p>
        <p>For example: consider the URI format:</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">
http://example.com/APP/CONTROLLER/ACTION/ID
</pre>
        <p>In this example, <em>APP</em> is the (optional) name of the application, <em>CONTROLLER</em> is the controller
        name, <em>ACTION</em> is the name of the action method to run and <em>ID</em> is a selector for an element
        in the Model. When the request URI is tokenized, the ESP HTTP router will extract the controller name and then
        use this name to load the appropriate controller to service the request.</p>

        <h3>Restful Routes</h3>
        <p>ESP applications will typically use a collection of Restful routes.
        Restful routes are a simple, readable, and familiar pattern for many developers and users. 
        They map common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> 
        operations to specific URIs and controller actions.</p>
        <p>ESP will create a initial set of Restful routes depending on the <em>esp.server.routes</em> configuration.</p>
<table class="ui table" title="routes">
    <thead>
<tr><th>Description</th><th>Method</th><th>Pattern</th><th>Action</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
<tr><td>controller</td><td>GET</td><td>/controller$</td><td>${controller}</td></tr>
<tr><td>delete</td><td>POST</td><td>/controller/{id=[0-9]+}/delete$</td><td>delete</td></tr>
<tr><td>create</td><td>POST</td><td>/controller(/)*$</td><td>create</td></tr>
<tr><td>edit</td><td>GET</td><td>/controller/{id=[0-9]+}/edit$</td><td>edit</td></tr>
<tr><td>get</td><td>GET</td><td>/controller/{id=[0-9]+}$</td><td>get</td></tr>
<tr><td>init</td><td>GET</td><td>/controller/init$</td><td>init</td></tr>
<tr><td>list</td><td>GET</td><td>/controller/list$</td><td>list</td></tr>
<tr><td>stream</td><td>GET</td><td>/controller/stream$</td><td>stream</td></tr>
<tr><td>remove</td><td>DELETE</td><td>/controller/{id=[0-9]+}$</td><td>remove</td></tr>
<tr><td>update</td><td>PUT</td><td>/controller/{id=[0-9]+}/{action}(/)*$</td><td>update</td></tr>
<tr><td>action</td><td>GET,POST</td><td>/controller//{id=[0-9]+}{action}$</td><td>${controller}/${action}</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
    <p>The delete route is a POST method variant of remove. The stream route is for WebSockets streaming of
    updates. </p>

        <h2 >Configuring Controllers</h2>
        <p>Controllers may be configured in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>As a stand-alone controller function.</li>
            <li>As part of an ESP MVC application</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stand-Alone Controllers</h3>
        <p>A stand-alone controller is not part of a broader ESP MVC application. It is complete unto itself. 
        Such controllers are very useful for web services and for discrete interfaces to server-side functions.</p>
        <p>To define a controller, you create an Appweb route using appweb.conf directives that specifies
            the route URI, the controller source file and the target mapping from URI to controller action. For example</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">
&lt;Route ^/greeting/{action}$ &gt;
    SetHandler espHandler
    Source greeting.c
    Target run greeting-$1
&lt;/Route&gt;
</pre>
        <p>This set of directives will create a route that will invoke the controller <em>controllers/greeting.c</em>.
        If the <em>/greeting/hello</em> URI is invoked, the <em>hello</em> action function will be invoked.
        The Target directive defines how the action function name to invoke. You can optionally use the
        <a href="../../appweb/users/dir/route.html#methods">Methods</a> directive to specify the support HTTP method verbs.</p>
        <h3>ESP MVC Applications</h3>
        <p>The Model-view-controller (MVC) architecture is a well-proven organization for web applications. 
        A key reason is that MVC apps separate the logic (<em>controllers</em>), from the presentation (<em>views</em>) 
        and the application's data (<em>models</em>). This clear partition of responsibilities, scales well and helps to 
        create maintainable applications.</p>
        <p>In an ESP MVC application, there are typically many <em>controllers</em> located by default 
        in the <em>controllers</em> directory.
        <p>ESP MVC applications and their controllers can be easily created via the 
        <a href="generator.html">esp</a> generator command. The <em>esp</em> command is used to create a bare ESP 
        MVC application with a directory for controllers, views, databases and other necessary configuration files. 
        For example:</p> 
        <pre class="ui code segment">esp generate app demo</pre>
        <p>The generated appweb.conf file will have an <a href="../../appweb/users/dir/esp.html#espApp">EspApp</a> 
        directive that defines the application and creates an initial set of MVC routes for the application.
        For example:</p>
        <pre class="ui code segment">EspApp name="store" prefix="/store" dir="./applications/store"</pre>
-->
            <a id="actions"></a>
            <h2 >Actions</h2>
            <p>Actions are where the controller does its work. In ESP, actions are simple "C" functions and thus
            they need to be registered with ESP before use. This is done in the controller module initialization function. 
            The initialization function is named: "<em>esp_controller_NAME</em>", where NAME is the unique 
            name of the controller. The first time the controller is invoked, the controller
            module will be loaded and the initialization function will be run. Typically, the initialization function 
            will then call
            <a href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_route_1ga321abe89cc91246b2a44f40493988670">espDefineAction</a> 
            to bind action functions to route actions.</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
#include "esp.h"
/* Actions */
static FUNCTION() {
    ...
}
/*
    Controller module initialization routine
 */
ESP_EXPORT int esp_controller_APP_NAME(HttpRoute *route) 
{
    espDefineAction(route, "NAME-ACTION", FUNCTION);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
            <p>If you want to programmatically bind a C function to a URI without creating a loadable module and without
            defining explicitly creating a route
            you can call the <a href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_route_1ga0d812aed0ff96f0ffa281860270e8910">espBindProc</a>
            API. This will create a new route by inheriting settings from an existing route and then define an action
            based on the supplied URI pattern. Because this creates a new route for each callback, it is best not to use
            if you have many callbacks.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">espBindProc(route, "/do/something", callback);</pre>
            <h3>Missing Actions</h3>
            <p>When responding to a request, if the required controller and action is not found, ESP will look for a
            corresponding ESP page of the same name. If that is not defined, ESP will respond with an HTTP 404 
            error indicating that the required action and page could not be found.</p>
            
            <a id="processing"></a>
            <h3>Processing the Request</h3>
            <p>The controller action can perform any processing it desires. There are no real restrictions except you don't
            want to block for too long without giving the client some feedback. Because ESP is multithreaded, you can
            block. In that case, the server will continue to run and serve other requests. However, note that threads
            are a limited resource. It may be better to use non-blocking techniques such as async processing.</p>
            <h3>Async Processing</h3>
            <p>An action may service a long-running request without blocking, by responding in pieces. 
            An action function may return without completing the request. Normally, ESP will automatically finalize
            the request when the action returns. To prevent this, call 
            <a href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_abbrev_1ga9db9b8b7e2c750f6f942da0478866de2">
            dontAutoFinalize</a> to tell ESP not to finalize the request and to keep the connection and
                response open. At anytime and from any other code, you may then call 
                <a href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_abbrev_1ga32d626626eee0bc4ade146973f6abb1c">finalize</a>
                to complete the request. To force output to the client, without finalizing, use 
                <a href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_abbrev_1ga32d626626eee0bc4ade146973f6abb1c">flush</a>.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
static void second(HttpConn *conn) {
    setConn(conn);
    render("World\n");
    finalize();
}
static void first() {
    dontAutoFinalize();
    render("Hello ");
    flush();
    <b>setTimeout(second, 5000, getConn());</b>
}
</pre>
            <p>This example will print "Hello ", then wait five seconds and then print "World". Note that the request
            is held open, but ESP is not blocked in any thread. The call to <em>setTimeout</em> will arrange to have
            the ESP event loop invoke <em>second</em> after five seconds have elapsed. This pattern is a 
            highly efficient in its use of system resources and scales very well.</p>
            <h3>Request Timeout Limits</h3>
            <p>ESP has a request timeout and a request inactivity timeout. If a request duration exceeds the limit
            defined via the RequestTimeout directive in appweb.conf, the request will be aborted. If the request does
            no I/O for more than the limit specified by the InactivityTimeout directive, it will be similarly aborted.
            These limits can be set per route in appweb.conf.</p>
            <h2>Loading and Caching Controllers</h2>
            <p>Before a controller can run, it must first be compiled and linked into a loadable library.
            On Windows, this will be a DLL, on Unix, it will be a shared library with a ".so" extension. On VxWorks it
            will be a loadable task module.</p>
            <p>The compilation of controllers into libraries happens automatically if a compiler is installed on the
            system and if the <em>EspUpdate</em> directive is enabled. If so, when a request is received, ESP will
            compile and link the controller as a library and save the result into the ESP <em>cache</em> directory
            for future use. After servicing the first request for the controller, the controller code is retained in
            memory and the controller will not be reloaded unless the source code is modified. If ESP is rebooted,
            the cached library will be reloaded without recompiling. This provides two levels of caching: in-memory and
            on-disk as a shared library.</p>
            <h3>Development and Production Modes</h3>
            <p>When a request for a controller is received, ESP will test if the source code has been updated to
            determine if the controller must be recompiled. If the source has been changed, ESP will wait for all
            requests that are using the already loaded controller, to gracefully complete. When no requests are using
            the old controller version, ESP will unload the controller, and ESP will recompile the updated controller
            source and create a new shared library that will then be loaded and the request servicing resumed.</p>
            <p>If ESP was configured and built in debug mode, the default value for <em>EspUpdate</em> will be
            <em>on</em>. If ESP was built in release mode, the default value is <em>off</em>. In release mode is it
            common practice to lock down the compiled controllers and not auto-recompile once deployed.</p>
            <a id="context"></a>
            <h2 >Controller Context</h2>
            <p>ESP establishes a request context for the controller before invoking the controller action. The top level 
            of the context is represented by the <a href="../ref/api/http.html#group___http_conn">HttpConn</a> 
            connection object. From this, all other request information can be reached, including the:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HttpRx object &mdash; describes the client HTTP request.</li>
                <li>HttpTx object &mdash; describes the client HTTP response.</li>
                <li>HttpHost object &mdash; describes the web server hosting the application.</li>
                <li>params &mdash; request query, form, and routing parameters.</li>
                <li>session state object &mdash; session state information.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>ESP Short-Form API</h3>
            <p>ESP defines a terse, short-form, 
            <a href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_abbrev">API</a> that uses the current connection object to
            provide context for the API. When using this API, explicit access to the connection object should not 
            typically be required. The ESP short-form API should cover 95% of requirements for action processing.</p>
            
            <h3>Explicit Connection Access</h3>
            <p>If explicit access to the connection object is required, action functions may
            define a connection argument as 
            which is passed into all actions.</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">static void ACTION(HttpConn *conn) {
    /* Use the conn reference here */
}</pre> 
            <p>Alternatively, the connection object can can be retrieved using the <a
                href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_abbrev_1gabe448b3542b4d1391e80e74192a09cb3">
                getConn</a> API.</p>
            <h3>Navigating the Connection Object</h3>
            <p>The <a href="../ref/api/http.html#group___http_conn">HttpConn</a> object represents the current
            TCP/IP connection. By using HTTP KeepAlive, the connection may be utilized for multiple requests. The fields
            of the HttpConn object are public and can be accessed and

            <h2 >Request Parameters</h2>
            <p>ESP will collect request query, form data and route parameters into one
            <em>params</em> object which is accessible to actions via the 
            <a href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_abbrev_1gad638c34898123293ebc120c1f9396a9c">param</a> API. Each query key/value pair and all
            request form elements posted by the client will become a properties of the <em>params</em> object.
            When routing the request, ESP will tokenize the URI and create parameters for each positional token in
            the URI. The Controller name and Action are defined as the parameters: <em>controller</em> and 
            <em>token</em>.</p>
            <a id="views"></a>
            <h3>Rendering Views</h3>
            <p>After processing the request, the controller is responsible for rendering a response back to the client. 
            The controller can choose how to respond. It may explicitly create the response body by calling
            <a href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_abbrev_1gaf89154adc3cbf6d6a6a32c6b4457c593">render</a> to generate HTML.
            Alternatively, the action may call 
            <a href="../ref/api/esp.html#group___esp_abbrev_1gaf0db430f850378bd83c514a0dda77fb9">renderView</a> to 
            response with a view web page.
            
            If the action method does not explicitly generate any response, ESP will invoke a view with the same name as
            the action method.</p>
            <a id="generating"></a>
            <h2 >Generating Controllers and Actions</h2>
            <p>If you are creating an MVC application, you may use the ESP application generator, called <em>esp</em> to
            make it quick and easy to create controllers, actions and controller scaffolds. To generate a new
            controller, run:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
esp generate CONTROLLER ACTIONS...
</pre>
            <p><em>CONTROLLER</em> is the controller name. <em>ACTIONS...</em> are the names of the actions you want to
            generate. This command will create the controller source file under the <em>controllers</em> directory. The
            controller source will contain empty functions for each of the requested actions.
            You can edit the controller source to meet your needs.</p>
